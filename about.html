        <p>Mr. Wise opened his first restauarant in Pomona, CA which had an idea of what to do for a business. He wanted to make food and his own cuisine that everyone can enjoy. At first, it was a small restaurant, but eventually it had long lines from miles that actually grew. The business has expanded for 10 years and will still continue growing and cooking.</p>
